zεlpst is my personal website/blog at http://zelp.st and http://zelpst.de.
The site is running [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/), a file-based CMS.

## OCTAVO

![screenshot](octavo.png)

[OCTAVO](http://zelp.st/blog/octavo-theme) is a theme for the Kirby CMS,
originally inspired by a blog post by Clive Thompson, [Why 18th century books looked like smartphone screens](http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2014/02/_thats_one_of_t.php).

Its very specific look and the need to include quite a number of
otherwise totally unnecessary fields in each post make it unlikely to be of
much use to anybody else, but should there be interest, I might create a
separate repository only of the theme files for easier distribution and try to
reduce the number of additional fields by generating their content dynamically.

Right now, OCTAVO is hardly more than an experiment. Consider it to be still
in Alpha. Use at your own risk.

## License

You are free to use, learn from, improve my own changes and additions to
the Kirby CMS basis which make my blog personal. Where applicable, I include
license informations in comments within the source code.

You are **not**, however, allowed to use the entirety of the code, i.e. the
Kirby platfiorm, to run your own blog without acquiring a Kirby license first!

*Please refer to the [Kirby website](http://getkirby.com/), the original
Readme `kirby.md` and of course `license.md` for informations about using
and licensing Kirby CMS.*
