Text:
WE confess the Follies of Youth without a Blush ; not so, those of Age. However keep me a little in countenance by considering, that Age wants Amusement more, thoâ€™ it can justify them less, than the preceding periods of life. How you may relish the Pastime here sent you, I know not. It is miscellaneous in its Nature, somewhat licentious in its Conduct; and, perhaps, not over important, and more suitable to my season of life. A serious Thought standing single among many of a lighter nature, will sometimes strike the careless Wanderer after Amusement only, with useful Awe : As monumental Marbles scattered in a wide Pleasure-Garden (and such there are) will call to Recollection those who would never have sought it in a Churchyard-walk of mournful Yews.

To One Such Monument I may conduct you, in which is a hidden Lustre like the sepulchral Lamps of old; but not like them will This be extinguished, but shine the brighter for being produced, after so long Concealment, into open Day.
